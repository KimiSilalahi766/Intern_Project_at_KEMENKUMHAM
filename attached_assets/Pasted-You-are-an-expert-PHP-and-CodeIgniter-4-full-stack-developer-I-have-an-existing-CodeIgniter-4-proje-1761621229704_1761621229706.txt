You are an expert PHP and CodeIgniter 4 full-stack developer. I have an existing CodeIgniter 4 project that needs to be completely improved and professionally rebuilt into a clean, functional web system.

🔧 GOAL:
Rebuild and enhance a CodeIgniter 4 web app that allows users to fill in form fields corresponding to placeholders inside a DOCX file, then automatically generate and download a new DOCX or PDF file with all placeholders replaced — while keeping the original layout, spacing, and page structure (7 pages total) exactly the same as the source file.

📄 SOURCE FILE:
The base DOCX file contains these placeholders that must be replaced dynamically through form inputs:
(Page 1)
- NAMA SATKER
- Alamat
- Telpon / Fax :
- Laman :
- Surel :
- nama satker

(Page 2)
- nama satker (several times)

(Page 3)
- nama satker (several times)

(Page 4)
- Triwulan III Tahun 2024 yakni ….%
- Upload file image for “capture nilai e-monev pada aplikasi”

(Page 5)
- Triwulan III Tahun 2024 yakni ….%
- Upload file image for “capture nilai SMART pada aplikasi”

(Page 6)
- nama satker
- Upload file image for “LAMPIRAN CAPTURE CAPAIAN E-ERFORMANCE PADA APLIKASI”

(Page 7)
- nama satker
- Section “adapun dalam pemenuhannya…” → exclude this sentence, but include 2 bullet points typed by user
- Section “Rencana tindaklanjut…” → exclude this sentence, but include 2 bullet points typed by user
- nama satker

⚙️ REQUIREMENTS:
1. Build the web interface in CodeIgniter 4 (latest stable version).
2. Design a professional Bootstrap 5 responsive front-end form.
3. The form must include:
   - Input text fields (Nama Satker, Alamat, Telp/Fax, Laman, Surel, Persentase E-Monev, Persentase SMART)
   - Upload fields for 3 image files (E-Monev, SMART, E-Performance)
   - Textareas for “Kendala” (2 points) and “Rencana Tindaklanjut” (2 points)
4. When submitted:
   - System loads the template DOCX file from `/app/Docs/template.docx`
   - Replaces placeholders according to user input.
   - Keeps **all page layout, spacing, and formatting identical** (must stay 7 pages).
   - Inserts uploaded images exactly where indicated (“capture nilai...” and “LAMPIRAN CAPTURE...”).
   - Outputs a downloadable DOCX and also offers PDF conversion option.
5. Use PHPWord for manipulating the DOCX template.
6. Use Dompdf (or PHPWord built-in PDF conversion) for generating PDF output.
7. Include a controller `ReportGenerator.php`, a model if necessary, and a view `form_report.php`.
8. Ensure error handling, validation, and success message.
9. Store uploaded images temporarily in `/writable/uploads/` and delete them after generation.
10. Optional: Include download logs (date, filename, user IP) in a simple SQLite or MySQL database table.

💡 Example flow:
1. User opens the form.
2. Fills in the form fields and uploads 3 images.
3. Clicks “Generate Report”.
4. System replaces all placeholders in the Word template.
5. User gets a button to download as DOCX or PDF.
6. The resulting document must still be exactly 7 pages, same margins and layout.

🎨 Additional:
- Use a clean, modern Bootstrap layout (container, card, labels, spacing, etc.)
- Add a simple header: “Laporan Evaluasi Capaian Nilai E-Monev, SMART dan E-Performance Triwulan III Tahun 2024”
- Keep all texts in Bahasa Indonesia as in the template.
- No styling should distort the DOCX layout.
- Add comments in English explaining each step of the code.

Final Deliverables:
- Fully functional CodeIgniter 4 project folder
- Controller file for generating and exporting Word/PDF
- View file containing the responsive form
- Working PHPWord integration that preserves the original 7-page layout
